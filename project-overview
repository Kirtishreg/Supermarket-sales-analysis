🎯 Aim

To analyze, predict, and forecast supermarket sales using data analytics and machine learning techniques, helping the business make data-driven decisions about performance, inventory, and customer trends.


📝 Introduction

Supermarkets collect large volumes of transactional data daily. This project uses historical sales data to derive insights into customer behavior, product performance, revenue trends, and store efficiency. By analyzing this data, we aim to improve strategic planning through predictive and forecasting models.


🧰 Libraries Used

pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

numpy – for numerical operations

matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization

scikit-learn – for machine learning (regression, classification)

statsmodels or pmdarima – for time series forecasting

plotly – for interactive visualizations (optional)

jupyter or streamlit – for notebooks or dashboards


📦 Requirements

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)

Dataset (CSV or Excel format)

🧹 Data Cleaning

Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal)

Convert date columns to datetime format

Normalize categorical data (e.g., gender, city)

Create new features (e.g., total price, day of week, month)

Encode categorical variables (Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding)

Remove or fix outliers if needed


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Sales by city, product line, gender

Revenue vs. quantity sold

Payment method distribution

Customer types and frequency

Correlation heatmaps

Time-based sales trends (monthly, weekly)


🤖 Predictive Modeling

Goal: Predict total sales or revenue.

Model Type: Regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Features: City, product line, customer type, quantity, etc.

Target: Total sales

Evaluation: MAE, MSE, R²

Optional: Classification models to predict customer satisfaction level or churn.


📈 Forecasting

Goal: Forecast future sales trends.

Use statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA) or pmdarima.auto_arima for time series forecasting.

Seasonal decomposition to analyze patterns (trend, seasonality, noise).

Train/test split on time-based data.

Visualize forecast vs. actual sales.


🧾 Conclusions

Identify best-performing cities and product lines.

Recognize customer preferences by gender and type.

Understand seasonal patterns in sales.

Estimate future revenue to help in inventory and staffing.
